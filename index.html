					<hr class="my-4">
					<p>Neotron is an attempt to make computers simple again, whilst also taking advantage of the very latest in programming language development. We are saddened by chat clients that require multi-Gigabyte installs, and systems with hundreds of millions of lines of source code that no one person could ever hope to understand. We want to build a machine that is sized for an individual to comprehend, not a trillion-dollar corporation.</p>
					<p>If you want a pithy sound-bite, it's like CP/M for tiny ARM microcontrollers, but written in Rust.</p>
